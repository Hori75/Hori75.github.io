        <p>(SPOILER ALERT) It’s not 100% coverage.
<!--more--></p>

<p>While learning programming and software engineering, I found this principle called “Test Driven Development”.
This principle is enforced on all assignments so me and my friends pretty much use it.
The main problem I found is that, the assignment was about creating a blog like web so I don’t really know what to test.
That problem got cleared up when I worked on an assignment to create a proper webapp [with database].
But, the next problem is the targetted coverage across all of my assignments are 100%.
I felt obliged to create test for every single line of code.</p>

<p>“Does it really used?”, I wonder. So I asked my friend who has internship as a software engineer.</p>

<p>“Nah, you just need to test if it works. If you could use unit test, use it.”</p>

<p>The main thing is, every company has its own stance about it.
But they don’t really enforce to reach 100% coverage and such.
Also, there is an argument against Test Driven Development.
Does Test Driven Development main principle is ignored?</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<p>Test Driven Development is a principle where you create tests first before create the implementations.
This is further elaborated (at least in my assignments) in creating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RED</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GREEN</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">REFACTOR</code> commits.
But, <strong>you don’t have to follow this since it’s only a principle not a rule.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/tdd-example.png" alt="TDD commits" /></p>

<h4 id="red">RED</h4>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RED</code> phase, you create skeleton objects and unit tests first in order to make the tests fail (hence it’s named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RED</code>).
You must not create implementation of the code, only empty class and functions are allowed.</p>

<h4 id="green">GREEN</h4>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GREEN</code> phase, you start create the main implementations and aim to pass all tests.
How much you need to implement it’s up to you, just get the test passed or do the proper and good implementations.</p>

<h4 id="refactor">REFACTOR</h4>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">REFACTOR</code> phase, you could evaluate your code and refactor it when necessary.</p>

<h4 id="repeat">Repeat</h4>

<p>After all of these, you repeat the process again by creating a failing test. Repeat until the project is completed.</p>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>

<p>Test Driven Development is quite useful when you have a clear minimum acceptance criteria. 
This will set your initial tests to be passed and you could build your test from there.
The main advantages from this is to make sure that your code has been tested.
The more code it covers, the lesser bug or errors you need to fix.</p>

<h3 id="main-objection-about-tdd">Main Objection about TDD</h3>

<p>The rapid phase of Test Driven Development is that you will do bad code practices in order to just fulfill the test.
Apart from that, we could create way too many lines of code just for unit testing instead of the real implementations.
This could get really worse when “100% coverage” is set as a requirement as it will force you to create code to test every inch of code you create.
The main thing is that you might create more tests than needed and even create technical debts you need to pay later on.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-missed-from-tdd">What is Missed from TDD</h3>

<p>First of all, we need to acknowledge that code coverage has no meaningful correlation code quality.
Coverage reports are created to detect any code flow that we left untested.
We need to remember that unit tests are created to give confidence that the code is working properly as intended if the test passed.
It’s main purpose is to make sure others’ changes don’t break the flow of the program.
The (ignored) main thing is Test Driven Development should be done to test <strong>the code behaviours, not all the implementations</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Test Driven Development is useful to shape developer’s habit to create test for code behaviour.
But this often to be overlooked and oversimplified to become rules that restrict the developer itself.
Code coverage shouldn’t be the main requirement for code quality, we only need to check if there is a code flow that isn’t covered yet.</p>
